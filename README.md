## ⚙ How It Works

The application provides a menu-driven interface that allows users to:

1. Add expense records  
2. Store data permanently in a JSON file  
3. Validate user input (amount, date, empty fields)  
4. Maintain structured financial records  

All data remains available even after restarting the program.
